Karen is the end user opening a ticket. She is reporting that mobile banking is completely down, and so from the menu she selects that this is a Business Critical Outage. In the last tutorial I showed you how to create help topics like "Business Critical Outage" to help categorize tickets that are coming in.

Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs, or changing departments if it is needed. Agents Like Jane Doe can post replies to tickets they are working on to explain what they are doing to resolve the issue.

In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket to Emergency since this issue is critical to the functioning of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. In some ticketing systems customers can set their own SLA plans. Jane Doe, the assigned Agent, posted a reply on the ticket stating that she along with the system administration team are working to resolve the issue.

Once issues are resolved, the Agent can close the ticket. The tickets will be removed from the que and placed in a different tab labeled for closed tickets. There you can see the date and time tickets were resolved and the agent that closed the ticket.
